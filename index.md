# Ensemble Reading Group

**This week's paper:**
[{{ site.papertitle }}]({{ site.paperurl }})
<br/>
**Next ensemble meeting:** {{ site.nextmeetingdate }}, {{ site.nextmeetingtime}} in {{ site.nextmeetingloc}}

The purpose of the Ensemble Reading Group is to broaden students' knowledge of
research in programming languages and verification. Ensemble also aims to give
students an opportunity to engage and establish a technical dialogue with one
another, posing thoughtful questions, interpreting research results, and
providing insightful answers.

We'll try to cover a variety of papers, but will often stick to the following
(non-exhaustive) varieties:

- **Classic papers** papers which are part of the programming languages "canon"
- **Current research papers** papers from the last several years that
represent the breadth of current research in programming languages
- **Related research papers**, papers in slightly different but fundamentally
related fields (i.e. theorem proving, formal methods, software engineering)
that can foster interaction with other students in the department

The format is described in four parts: how we select papers, what occurs
before we meet to discuss, what occurs during the meeting, and what occurs
afterward. Each Concert reading group session involves three roles, the
*Convener*, the *Leader*, and the *Guide*.

## Before the Discussion

Each participant is responsible for:

1. **Reading the paper.**
2. **A list of (at least one) questions, comments or issues raised by the
paper.** Questions may touch on specific technical details or raise broad
concerns philosophical anything that will initiate discussion or improve your
understanding of the paper. Asking questions does not require expertise, and
asking to learn something is a productive way to contribute to the discussion.

**No slides are drafted for the discussion.** No single member is
"responsible"  for a given paper, but the Convener selects a Guide, a student
that has some familiarity with the subject area and can ensure that general
questions can be answered (younger students are encouraged to be Guides, but
older students will often fill this role). That said, don't expect to show up
and glean the content of the paper from the discussion. As you'll see below,
we don't waste any time in summarizing the paper.

## During the Discussion

We begin each discussion by "going around the table," sharing our questions
and comments and listing them on the whiteboard. At this point, however, we
try to limit the discussion of these questions: the goal is to create an
outline for the remainder of the session. By tradition, the last individual to
arrive is given the honor of offering the first question.

The Guide and the Leader are the primary roles during the discussion, and
should be two different people.

- **The Guide** is there to increase the likelihood that some answer can be found
to most questions, but their primary role is answering questions, not proposing them.
- **The Leader** may be the same person as the Convener, and is also a good role
for younger students. He or she leads the discussion, and tries to make sure that
the discussion stays on track. In particular, the leader is responsible:
    - To ensure that discussion continues to move from one topic to the next and
    that it doesn't get bogged down, and
    - To verify that questions are answered (to the satisfaction of the asker) or
    that some time in the future is set aside to continue the discussion.
